# Note: The following are NOT included for cloud deployment due to size/compatibility:
# - mediapipe: Requires Python 3.8-3.12, large binary, webcam features won't work on cloud anyway
# - torch/torchvision: Very large (~2GB), SAM2 not practical for free tier hosting
# - sam2: Requires torch, large model files

# These features will gracefully fallback or show "not available" messages on cloud:
# - Pose & Hand Tracking (MediaPipe) - works locally only
# - SAM2 Segmentation - uses GrabCut fallback on cloud
# - Webcam-based tracking - requires local deployment
